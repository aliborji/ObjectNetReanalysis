ObjectNet Reanalysis and Annotations
=====================

April 1, 2020


**News**: Manuscript is avaiable in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02042.pdf).




* The code works with **PyTorch 1.0.0 or higher.






This repository provides bounding box annotations of the ObjectNet dataset
by Barbu et al. NIPS 2019. 



About the ObjectNet dataset:
Taken from the ObjectNet repository README.md, verbatim:
"ObjectNet is an object recognition dataset developed at MIT in CSAIL &
BCS as well as CBMM (Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines) and at
the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. It intentionally adds variation to the
background, viewpoint, and rotation of objects during the image
capturing process while minimizing correlations between these
properties and object class. Removing these biases challenges current
object detectors. We hope that this will lead to new detectors and new
ideas in machine learning as well a more rigorous and scientific
approaches to datasets everywhere.

ObjectNet has no training set! The ObjectNet license, attached, which
you agree to in order to use this work, EXPLICITLY FORBIDS UPDATING
THE PARAMETERS OF ANY MODEL BASED ON THESE IMAGES. Our goal is for
ObjectNet and datasets like it to produce accuracies that are
predictive of what any user, including you, will see in the real world
when deploying object detectors."
